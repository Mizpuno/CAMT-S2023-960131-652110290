                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>
                    Tesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. 
                    The company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. 
                    In February 2004, via a $6.5 million investment, Elon Musk became the largest shareholder of the company. 
                    He has served as CEO since 2008. According to Musk, the purpose of Tesla is to help expedite the move to 
                    sustainable transport and energy, obtained through electric vehicles and solar power. Tesla began
                    production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, in 2008.

                <h3>Founder</h3>
                <p>
                    As lead designer at SpaceX, Elon oversees the development of rockets and spacecraft for missions to Earth 
                    orbit and ultimately to other planets. In 2008, the SpaceX Falcon 1 was the first privately developed liquid 
                    fuel rocket to reach orbit, and SpaceX made further history in 2017 by re-flying both a Falcon 9 rocket and 
                    Dragon spacecraft for the first time. Soon after, Falcon Heavy, the most powerful operational rocket in 
                    the world by a factor of two, completed its first flight in 2018. In 2019, SpaceXâ€™s crew-capable version 
                    of the Dragon spacecraft completed its first demonstration mission, and the company will fly NASA astronauts 
                    to the International Space Station for the first time in 2020.

                    The Model S was the bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide for the years 2015 and 2016, 
                    selling an estimated 50,931 units in 2016.[41] By the end of 2017, it was the world's second 
                    bestselling plug-in electric car in history (after the Nissan Leaf), with global sales of 
                    200,000 units.[112] In June 2020, Tesla announced that the Model S Long Range Plus had an EPA
                     range of 402 miles (647 km), the highest of any battery electric vehicle at the time.
