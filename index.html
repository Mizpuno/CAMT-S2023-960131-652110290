                Tesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. 
                The company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. 
                In February 2004, via a $6.5 million investment, Elon Musk became the largest shareholder of the company. 
                He has served as CEO since 2008. According to Musk, the purpose of Tesla is to help expedite the move to 
                sustainable transport and energy, obtained through electric vehicles and solar power. Tesla began
                production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, in 2008. This was followed by the Model S 
                sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, 
                and the Tesla Semi truck in 2022. The company plans to start production of the Cybertruck light-duty pickup truck in 2023.
